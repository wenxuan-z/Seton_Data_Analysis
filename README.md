# Seton Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to see how the time for patients to get administered medicines after diagnosis of COVID-19 changes over time from 2020 to 2021 using data from Dell Seton Medical Center. Determining whether age, gender, race, ethnicity, and pre-existing medical conditions have an impact on patient rates of palliative care consultation and death is another important goal. The use of end of life medicines is also analyzed.
